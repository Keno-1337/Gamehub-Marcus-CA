An e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS and JS

## Description

As part of my front-end studies we were tasked with creating an e-commerce webpage. We had a couple of different ideas to choose from - I chose a video game retailer.
This is the brief we were given:

You must deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief you chose in Design 1.

The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.

  - The HTML should be semantic and neat.
  - The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
  - The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS       framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
  - The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
